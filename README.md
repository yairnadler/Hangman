# Hangman
This is my attempt to create a hangman game in python\n
To play the game simply change the words in the 'words' text file, sperated by space, to change the word to be guessed\n
Next, eneter the paths to the relevant .txt files in the code file (they are marked with a comment in the main function)\n
After that run the python program to play
Hope you enjoy!
